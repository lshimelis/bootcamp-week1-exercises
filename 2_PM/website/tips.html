                <ol>
                    <li>Larger Aperture to allow it to gather more light (which means more detail)</li>
                    <li>ISO setting of 800 is a general Golidocks point, but you are encouraged to test other ISO settings</li>
                    <li>Based on the ISO setting, a shutter speed between 10 and 30 seconds should be a good baseline </li>
                    <li>Always choose manual focus over automatic so you have more flexibility to change the settings</li>
              </ol>
